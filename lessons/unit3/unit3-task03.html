<div class="romeo"><span class="speaker">ROMEO</span> I take thee at thy word: Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized; Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</div>
<div class="juliet"><span class="speaker">JULIET</span> What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my counsel?</div>
<div class="romeo"><span class="speaker">ROMEO</span> By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, Because it is an enemy to thee; Had I it written, I would tear the word.</div>
<div class="juliet"><span class="speaker">JULIET</span> My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound: Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?</div>
<div class="romeo"><span class="speaker">ROMEO</span> Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</div>
<div class="juliet"><span class="speaker">JULIET</span> How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</div>
<div class="romeo"><span class="speaker">ROMEO</span> With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.</div>
<div class="juliet"><span class="speaker">JULIET</span> If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</div>
<div class="romeo"><span class="speaker">ROMEO</span> Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.</div>
<div class="juliet"><span class="speaker">JULIET</span> I would not for the world they saw thee here.</div>
